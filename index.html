<!-- INTRODUCTION -->

	<div class="paddedIntro small">
		<p>In “Superwomen: Gender, power and representation” her book on gender representation in comics, author Carolyn Cocca writes:</p>

		<p>Avid comic readers will already know that female characters are, on the whole, represented drastically different than their male counterparts. They are hyper-sexualized, unnecessarily-brutalized, weak, infantilized, token and, frankly, just rare. About 30% of all DC and Marvel characters are female, and only 12% of mainstream superhero comics star female characters (footnote, Cocca, p.1).</p> 

		<p>Using the <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/">ComicVine database</a>, which is fan-edited, we downloaded information for all 34,000 (TK) characters in the Marvel and DC universes. The choice of the 'big two' was made to cover the greatest breadth and history of characters; these companies have both been around since the 1930's and together they are responsible for approximately 70% of the <a href="http://www.diamondcomics.com/Home/1/1/3/237?articleID=100122">retail market</a> (depending on the month)</p>

		<p>A note about gender: This piece is unfortunately only focused on male and female gender. In the database there is the designation of female, male or other. I made the decision to remove the characters that appeared in the 'other' category. Initially I had hoped this data would provide some insight into non-binary or gender fluid characters in the Marvel and DC universes, but once I took a closer look, it became clear that the category is not often used in a gender-inclusive way, but instead as a way to label some non-human non-human characters, like robots, auras and spirits. </p>




		<p>“Wonder Woman of the forties was not the same as Wonder Woman of the fifties ... When you're asking different populations about what wonder woman was like, you can get different answers. There are certain things about these long-standing characters, like a Superman or a Wonder Woman, that remain the same, but then there are other things that change over time depending on the writer, the artist, the editor, the company, what medium comics are being delivered in, how they're being sold ... so there are a lot of reasons why they change over time.”
		Make sure to mention something about DC and Marvel and their share of the comics industry.</p>

<!-- POINT AND POSE POWERS -->
	<div class="paddedBody small">
		<h3 class="midTitle">Point and pose powers</h3>
		<p>If we break down powers by gender, we notice that the distribution is inline with comic stereotypes: women are overrepresented in powers that emanate from the mind and involve empathy; and highly physical powers, or those that involve powerful objects, tend to be given to males. These untaxing female abilities are refered to as 'point and pose' powers. </p>

		<p> About the same percentage of female and male characters possess powers of some sort — almost 40%. And they tend to have the same top powers — unarmed combat (20% of males, 21% of females), intellect, agility, super strength and flight. 
		</p>

		<p>Some of the more interesting findings are in the powers that show up a little less often. And it is when we begin to look at percent differences that we can really see the stereotypes come alive. For example, if you compare the percentage of male and female characters that list 'empathy' as a power, we notice the power is overrepresented in women by a significant 144%. 
		</p>

		<p>In addition, we find that while female characters have a number of outlier powers — powers where the percent differences between male and female characters are great — male characters do not. Enhance mutation, matter absorption, penance stare and berserker strength are the powers most dominated by men (as a percent difference). The percent differences aren’t huge, however. The greatest percent difference is only 65%, while on the female side we find many powers with much greater differences. What does this mean? Well, it suggests that there are some powers that are specifically female powers, while there are few specifically male powers.

<!-- GENDERED NAMES SECTION-->
	<div class="paddedBody small">
		<h3 class="midTitle">Little Miss Lassgirl</h3>
		<p> Two thirty-year-old superheroes charge into panel: One is Hero-Man, the other is Hero-Girl. Their villains show up — it's King Baddie and Princess Baddie. They are saved by their sidekicks: Sir Help and Miss Assistance. Do you notice a difference? Inequality in gendered superhero names is a common trope. Why is there a Batman, but his gendered counterpart is Batgirl? Why is SuperMan's gender counterpart Super Girl?</p>

		<p>Not all gendered names are equal. Some names fit an 'adult' category, while others are their diminutive versions. For example, girl is the diminutive version of woman. If we look compare the use of diminutive names for male and female characters, we see that 33% of female characters (with diminutive names) and 16% of male characters (with diminutive names) fit in the category. Females are almost twice as likely to be given a name that makes her seem weak, infantilized, less aggressive and not on the same playing field as male characters.
		</p>

	</div>

	<hr class="note tk-atlas small">
		<p class="note tk-atlas small"><strong>DIMINUTIVE NAMES:</strong> When I say 'diminutive names' these are the ones I considered. Female: girl, daughter, miss, ms. princess, lass, damsel, mademoiselle, chick, doll, gal. Male: boy, son, prince, lad, bro, junior. There are good arguments for both keeping and removing many of these terms from the list — but the point remains: Even if you only look at 'girl' and 'boy' there's a significant difference: 13% for females, 5% for males.</p>

	<p class="note tk-atlas small">DATA NOTES: Percentages are determined only from characters with gendered names. (ie. 13% of women with gendered names have 'girl' in their name). In the DC and Marvel universes, 12% of all male characters habe gendered names, and 8.7% of female characters have gendered names.<br><br>In some cases a character with a gendered name will be listed in the Comic Vine database under their secret identity. For example, you will find no Ms. Marvel or Batgirl in the chart above. They are listed in the data as Carol Danvers (and Kahala Khan and others) and Barbara Gordon.</p>

			Making things even more clear, we chart the percent difference. How we see immediately that a) there are specifically female powers, where we don't really see that for men and b) the powers that favour women are of the point and pose variety.

		<p class="expertText">“I read a few studies about novels, about children's books specifically, about cartoons, about movies, about tv shows. The numbers are basically the same in all these places. But one of the things that these studies have also found is that women are just less likely to be ... not only are they less likely to be a team leader, they are less likely to be in any kind of leadership position at all. So in all fiction, women were number one, almost never shown at work, they were usually shown in the home, and number two, when they were shown at work they were not the CEO, the professional, the doctor, the lawyer, the board member. Those positions were all taken by men. Then it seems to me unsurprising that you would find the same things in comics, because it's in all these media.”</p>

	<p> Both male and female characters are equally likely to be on teams. Of all characters, 46% are on a team — where 49% of females are on a team, and 48% of males are on a team. However, there is a significant difference when we look at the make-up of the teams themselves.

		<p class="expertText">“I would argue that things are getting better in how women are represented. But I would say that with the caveat that there are still such a small number of female characters that they're still carrying that virtually impossible representational weight. Because there are so few, you can't have a spectrum of different types of females, and so if you only have the one female character on the team, which you still mostly do, and then you compare her to the several men characters on the team, there's just no way she can be well-rounded enough."</p>

	<hr class="note tk-atlas small">
	<p class="note tk-atlas small"><strong>SOME NOTES ON DATA:</strong> Character duplication: Because I gathered every single character from both universes, there are occasionally duplicates of characters. For example, there are at least six robins. There’s a good argument for getting rid of them: They overweight some of the big characters, because it’s usually only the main characters that are replace, or reborn, etc. However, there’s a good argument for keeping them as well. They can be considered different characters (Batman-X is not the same as Batman, for example). Removing duplicates would also mean losing out if the character changes gender. Example: There are at least six iterations of Robin, but only four of them are male</p>

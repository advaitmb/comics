<!-- INTRODUCTION -->

	<div class="paddedIntro small">
		<p>Avid comic readers will already know that female characters are, on the whole, represented drastically different than their male counterparts. They are hyper-sexualized, unnecessarily-brutalized, weak, infantilized, token and, frankly, just rare. About 30% of all DC and Marvel characters are female, and only 12% of mainstream superhero comics star female characters (footnote, Cocca, p.1). Much has been written on the gender imbalances in superhero comics, though very little exploration has been done of the data. What can we say about female characters just looking at the numbers?</p> 
		<p>Using the <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/">ComicVine database</a>, which is fan-edited, we downloaded information for all 34,000 (TK) characters in the Marvel and DC universes. The choice of the 'big two' was made to cover the greatest breadth and history of characters; these companies have both been around since the 1930's and together they are responsible for approximately 70% of the <a href="http://www.diamondcomics.com/Home/1/1/3/237?articleID=100122">retail market</a> (depending on the month).</p>
		<p>By looking at the data behind power distribution, team make-up and character naming, we can see significant differences in the representation between males and females in DC and Marvel.</p>
		<p>It's as good a time as any to look at how females are portrayed in the billion-dollar, global industry that is superheroes. Marvel and DC are no longer simply convenience-store singles, now they're blockbuster movies, fast-selling merchandise, drama-filled tv shows and popular video games. The more we see these characters appear in pop culture, and because female characters are such a small fraction overall, the more their representation matters.</p>
		<p>In <i>Superwomen: Gender, power and representation</i>, author Carolyn Cocca writes: "If the constantly repeated story is that women and girls are not leaders, are not working in professional settings, are not agents of their own lives but merely adjuncts to others, and are sometimes not even present at all, it can reinforce or foster societal undervaluing of women and girls... As there are fewer female characters to begin with, each is overburdened with representing women as a group."</p>

		<!-- <p>“Wonder Woman of the forties was not the same as Wonder Woman of the fifties ... When you're asking different populations about what wonder woman was like, you can get different answers. There are certain things about these long-standing characters, like a Superman or a Wonder Woman, that remain the same, but then there are other things that change over time depending on the writer, the artist, the editor, the company, what medium comics are being delivered in, how they're being sold ... so there are a lot of reasons why they change over time.”
		Make sure to mention something about DC and Marvel and their share of the comics industry.</p> -->

<!-- POINT AND POSE POWERS -->
	<div class="paddedBody small">
		<h3 class="midTitle">Point and pose powers</h3>
		<p>If we break down powers by gender, we notice that the distribution is inline with the comic stereotype that women are weak and non-physical. We see female characters overrepresented in powers that emanate from the mind and involve empathy; and highly physical powers, or those that involve powerful objects, tend to be given to males. These untaxing female abilities are sometimes refered to as 'point and pose' powers. </p>
		<p> About the same percentage of female and male characters possess powers of some sort — almost 40%. And they tend to have the same top powers — unarmed combat (20% of males, 21% of females), intellect, agility, super strength and flight. 
		</p>
		<p>Some of the more interesting findings are in the powers that show up a little less often. And it is when we begin to look at percent differences that we can really see the stereotypes come alive. For example, if you compare the percentage of male and female characters that list 'empathy' as a power, we notice the power is overrepresented in women by a significant 144%. 
		</p>
		<p>In addition, we find that while female characters have a number of outlier powers — powers where the percent differences between male and female characters are great — male characters do not. Enhance mutation, matter absorption, penance stare and berserker strength are the powers most dominated by men (as a percent difference). The percent differences aren’t huge, however. The greatest percent difference is only 65%, while on the female side we find many powers with much greater differences. What does this mean? It suggests that there are some powers that are specifically female powers, while there are few specifically male powers.

These powers are within the noise, meaning there may be a real difference between the genders, but there also may not.<br><br>Percentages are determined only from characters with powers.

<!-- EXPERT OPINION-->
	<div class="expertOpinion">
		<h3 class="tk-atlas medium expert">Expert opinion</h3>
		<br><br><br>
		<p class="expertText">“[Traditionally], female characters are more likely to have these pose and stand and point type of powers... So they're not punching people, and they're not necessarily getting punched in return. ... and so they just kind of stand there and look pretty and you might see little rays emanating from their head and they might be pointing at someone or something like that. I'm sure it goes with the idea that women are not supposed to be physically strong, but they are supposed to be empathetic, and they're sensitive to emotions.” — Carolyn Cocca (interview)</p>

		<p> Both male and female characters are equally likely to be on teams. Of all characters, 46% are on a team — where 49% of females are on a team, and 48% of males are on a team. However, there is a significant difference when we look at the make-up of the teams themselves and how females appear within them. </p>

		<p>Dissapointingly, the more members a team has, the more likely the team is to have fewer female characters than men. Even the X-Men, one of the most-popular teams of all time, don't have parity. With a name like that, though, what do you expect? Aside from the Amazons (which is an outlier as a large, almost-all woman group), the largest group to have more woman than men is the Daily Bugle — and it's not even a team! (Interestingly, this female-male ratio is better than in most real-life newsrooms (link).) </p>

		<p> Particularly interesting are the names of the teams that are 100% female — Femizons, Lady Liberators, Female Furies, Holiday Girls, Doom Maidens — and those are just in the largest six all-female teams. These groups have gendered names in the way that the male teams generally do not. Given the highly gendered naming, it suggests that all-women teams are often considered a bit of a gimmick.</p>

		<p class="expertText">“I would argue that things are getting better in how women are represented. But I would say that with the caveat that there are still such a small number of female characters that they're still carrying that virtually impossible representational weight. Because there are so few, you can't have a spectrum of different types of females, and so if you only have the one female character on the team, which you still mostly do, and then you compare her to the several men characters on the team, there's just no way she can be well-rounded enough." — Carolyn Cocca (interview)</p>

		<p class="expertText">"[Women] would basically be a token on the team, and very often that token would be the weakest member of the team, the weak link, the one that got captured, the one de-powered, the one that messed up and had to be rescued. And when you're just 'the girl' on the team, then that just reinforces, “well, why have female characters, because they're always like that? They're always the one that needs to be rescued."  — Carolyn Cocca (interview)</p>

		<p> Two thirty-year-old superheroes charge into the panel: One is Hero-Man, the other is Hero-Girl. Their villains show up — it's King Baddie and Princess Baddie. They are saved by their sidekicks: Sir Help and Miss Assistance. Do you notice a difference? Inequality in gendered superhero names is a common trope. Why is there a Batman, but his gendered counterpart is Batgirl? Why is SuperMan's gender counterpart Super Girl?</p>
		<p>Not all gendered names are equal. Some names fit a 'diminutive' category. These are monikers that are the younger, or infantilized version of another name. For example, girl is the diminutive version of woman. If we compare the use of diminutive names for male and female characters, we see that 33% of female characters and 16% of male characters fit in the category. Females are almost twice as likely to be given a name that makes her seem weak, infantilized, less aggressive and not on the same playing field as male characters.

There are good arguments for both keeping and removing many of these terms — but the point remains: Even if you only look at 'girl' and 'boy' there's a significant difference: 13% for females, 5% for males.</p>

		<p class="expertText">"The de-aging of characters, particularly female characters, can make them appear as less dangerous. But their characterization is crucial.

		<p></p>
		<p>Let's continue to dig into the name data. Some characters are given names that correspond to their professions. These names include titles like Dr. Doom, Professor X, and Commissioner Gordon. There are 1672 characters given names with titles — 193 female characters and 1479 male characters. Already we see a discrepency. Women make up about 30% of the characters in the dataset. If all things were equal, there would also be 30% of characters with titles that are female. This is not the case. Only 13% of characters with titles are female. not many characters for whom their profession is important enough to be included in their name, but for those that are, there is a clear bias toward giving male characters professional titles. In the chart below we see female stereotypes popping out. Women are only in the caring professions: nurses (by a significant difference!) and doctors,

		<p class="expertText">“I read a few studies about novels, about children's books specifically, about cartoons, about movies, about tv shows. The numbers are basically the same in all these places. But one of the things that these studies have also found is that women are just less likely to be ... not only are they less likely to be a team leader, they are less likely to be in any kind of leadership position at all. So in all fiction, women were number one, almost never shown at work, they were usually shown in the home, and number two, when they were shown at work they were not the CEO, the professional, the doctor, the lawyer, the board member. Those positions were all taken by men. Then it seems to me unsurprising that you would find the same things in comics, because it's in all these media.”</p>

And a quote about how they are getting better, but women are still such a small fraction, and these female characters carry all the representational baggage of their past, that this issue still has a long way to go.

	<p class="note tk-atlas medium"><strong>DATA AND METHODOLOGY</strong></p>
	<p class="note tk-atlas small"><strong>GENDER:</strong> This piece is unfortunately only focused on male and female gender. In the database there are designations for 'female', 'male' and 'other'. I made the decision to remove the characters that appeared in the 'other' category. I had hoped this data would provide some insight into non-binary or gender fluid characters in the Marvel and DC universes. Once I took a closer look, however, it was clear that the category is not often used in a gender-inclusive way. Instead, it is mostly used as a way to label non-human characters, like robots, auras and spirits. </p>
	<p class="note tk-atlas small"><strong>CHARACTER DUPLICATION: </strong>Because I gathered every single character from both universes, there are occasionally duplicates of characters. For example, there are at least six robins. There’s a good argument for removing them: They over-weight some of the big characters, because it’s usually only the more common, popular characters that are replaced, or reborn, etc. However, there’s a good argument for keeping them as well. They can be considered different characters (Batman-X is not the same as Batman, for example), and as such, they have distinct genders. Removing duplicates would mean missing out if the character changes gender. For example: There are at least six iterations of Robin, but only four of them are male.</p>
